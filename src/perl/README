                   Miscellaneous Utilities
                   -----------------------

The wiki-scrub.pl utility will take a wikipedia page, marked up in the
standard Wikipedia XML format, and remove all markup, leaving only
plain text. The goal is to have generate text that can be input into
Relex.

The cff-to-opencog.pl utility will convert the relex compact file format
(written out by relex.WebFormat via output/CompactView.java), and
convert it into the opencog format (compatible with what
output/OpenCogScheme.java would produce).

The cpu-control.pl utility will monitor overall CPU usage on a system,
and halt parsing jobs when the cpu usage gets to high. It will restart
the jobs when cpu usage drops. It has a response time of a few seconds.
