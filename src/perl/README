                   Miscellaneous Utilities
                   -----------------------

The wiki-scrub.pl utility will take a wikipedia page, marked up in the
standard Wikipedia XML format, and remove all markup, leaving only
plain text. The goal is to have generate text that can be input into
Relex.

The cff-to-opencog.pl utility will convert the relex compact file format
(written out by relex.WebFormat via output/CompactView.java), and
convert it into the opencog format (compatible with what
output/OpenCogScheme.java would produce).
