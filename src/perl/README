                   -----------------------

The wiki-scrub.pl file will take a wikipedia page, marked up in the
standard Wikipedia XML format, and remove all markup, leaving only
plain text. The goal is to have generate text that can be input into
Relex.

The xxx utility will convert the compact file format into the opencog
format.
