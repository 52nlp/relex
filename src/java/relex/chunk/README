Unit tests:
-----------
 * I TOOK her TO the dance.
       (VP took (NP her) (PP to (NP the dance)))

   Skip the NP's, to get "took to"

 * He will TAKE OFFICE ON monday.
      (S (NP He) (VP will (VP take office (PP on (NP Monday)))) .)

   need to drop PP in VP, to get "take office on"

 * General Custer gave the Sioux chief no quarter.
      (S (NP General Custer) (VP gave (NP the Sioux chief) (NP no quarter)) .)
