           Anaphora resolution via Hobbs algorithm
           ---------------------------------------

The code in this directory implements a slightly modified
version of Hobbs algorithm for anaphora resolution.  That is,
it resolves the references "he" and "it" in the example text
"John went to the door. He opened it."

A more extensive set of tested examples are in 
"test-corpus.txt"

ToDo:
----
"Do you see the doggie bed? Go there and lie down".
"John and I saw the bridge. We went there."

-- For this example,  I think location resolution could proceed much
as pronoun resolution: "there" refers to "bridge".  This isn't yet
implemented.

-- The current relex output format has trouble representing
"John and I" as the antecedent to "we".  This is a variant
of the "phrase heads" problem with the cerego code.

I'm not sure what a clean resolution to this would be,
perhaps:

_phrase("John and I", idnum_1)
_ante(we,idnum_1)

Note the introduction of the artificial label, which breaks
current relex style. Alternately,

_ante(we, "John and I")

which breaks the current style by using quotation marks
for strings longer than one word.
